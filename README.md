# Circuit_Walk
Circuit Optimization using random hill-climbing algorithm

Uses package pyltspice from Nunobrum

Creates a netlist from a .asc file created in LTSpice software and updates the netlist based on a error comparison between the previous best and the current
circuit output.

Uses a simple waveform to compare to, need to create model to compare the circuit outputs to for actual use.
